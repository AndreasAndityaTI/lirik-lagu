I know that we are upside down
So hold your tongue and hear me out
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

You kill the lights, I'll draw the blinds
Don't dull the sparkle in your eyes
I know that we were made to break
So what? I don't mind

Are you gonna stay the night?
Are you gonna stay the night?
Ho, oh, oh, oh, are you gonna stay the night?
